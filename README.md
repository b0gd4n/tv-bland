TV Bland was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies and `npm start` to start local server.

TODOs:
- Implement local pagination (the TVMaze API does not seem to have any pagination functionality implemented)
- Facilitate responsive images
- Create tests
- Add date selection functionality for the schedule page-content
- Create decent loading state module
- Use SCSS variables & implement grid system
- Refactor the `Show Info` & `Starring` sections on the show page to align row borders
